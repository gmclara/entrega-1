Our *Git*, who art in the repositories,
Compressed be thy *commits*.
Thy *log* come to us,
In the local as well as in the *remote*.
Give us today our daily *pull*,
Forgive us our *conflicts*,
As we also forgive those of other geeks.
Lead us not into *detached HEAD*,
And deliver us from *SVN*.
`git commit --amend`
